TODO list for this project:

(DONE) 1) Interpret z_velocity commands as y_velocity commands just for now
        -Old jank/temporary code for spin: 
            // If the Z is positive, we spin counter clockwise
            if(z_velocity.data > 0.0){
                robotSpinCounterClockwise(z_velocity);
            }
            // Else we spin clockwise
            else{
                // Pass in negative z_velocity
                robotSpinClockwise(z_velocity);
            }


2) Make sure that when in neutral position, it completely stops the robot
    -Alter the friction values of the wheels or maybe look into the motor limits and efforts
3) Add a marker to the front of the robot
(DONE) 4) Add an IMU sensor
    -Needs tunning/need to input gaussian values for our IMU sensor that we bought
(DONE) 5) Add a Lidar sensor once Lidar stand is complete
    -Need to add in the stand model
    -Need to input values for our RP lidar sensor
    -Current lidar sensor mimicks Hokuyo lidar. But it only sees 180 degrees. Need to change to 360 degrees
    -Need to have it show up on rviz somehow? Might not be needed.

6) Start looking into gmapping or hector mapping
    - Need to create a better world
    - Need to update inputs for better interpretation of cmd_vel
    - Need an odom frame?
